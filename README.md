## What is it ?

Inspired from the flipper zero gui editor: https://ilin.pt/stuff/fui-editor/

This app permit to generate a local asset library than can be used to compose gui screens for esphome.

Before getting started, the app is intended to be used as a devcontainer. To use it, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Running without the provided devcontainer

It's possible to run the have with a correct python + node.js dev environement but this won't be covered in this readme for now.

- [x] wysiwyg editor, to help designing gui/display pages
- [ ] generate declarative yaml for gui stuffs
- [ ] output exemple lambda to draw the stuff you see on the canvas, with correct ids and offsets
- [x] realtime rendering of animations
- [x] autogenerated ressources catalog (toolbox) from esphome's data folders for fonts, images and animations folders
- [ ] elements assets zip download for sharing with packaged config

### Future features:

- [ ] support display pages
- [ ] use wasm to run the lamda's cpp code, running esphome's display component, in the browser (working poc)

## How to use

This app is intended to be used locally, as a companion to your esphome installation.

It uses devcontainers, so you have a ready to use dev environement to run the app.
