# GUI helper for ESPHome

inspired from the flipper zero gui editor: https://ilin.pt/stuff/fui-editor/

## base concepts/features:

- [x] wysiwyg editor, to help designing gui/display pages
- [ ] generate declarative yaml for gui stuffs
- [ ] output exemple lambda to draw the stuff you see on the canvas, with correct ids and offsets
- [x] realtime rendering of animations
- [x] autogenerated ressources catalog (toolbox) from esphome's data folders for fonts, images and animations folders
- [ ] elements assets zip download for sharing with packaged config

## later:

- [ ] use wasm to run the lamda's cpp code, running esphome's display component, in the browser (working poc)
- [ ] support display pages

# Generate the assets

1. edit the config/catalog.yaml
2. run the assets build command

```bash
  python3 scripts/generateData.py
```

# Run the webapp

You can now run the webapp and design display pages with your assets

```bash
  cd webapp
  npm run dev
```
