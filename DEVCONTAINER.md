# Introduction

A devcontainer is a Docker container that provides a consistent development environment for a project. It allows developers to easily set up their development environment without having to install all of the necessary dependencies on their local machine.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to use a devcontainer featured in a Github repo project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Step 1: Clone the repository

First, clone the repository containing the devcontainer to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

Replace `USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME` with the appropriate values for your repository.

## Step 2: Open the repository in Visual Studio Code

Next, open the repository in Visual Studio Code by running the following command:

```
code REPO_NAME
```

## Step 3: Install the Remote - Containers extension

In Visual Studio Code, click on the extensions icon on the left sidebar and search for `Remote - Containers`. Install the extension.

## Step 4: Open the devcontainer

In Visual Studio Code, click on the green icon in the bottom left corner of the window that says "Open Folder in Container". This will open the devcontainer for the repository.

## Step 5: Start developing

You can now start developing in the devcontainer as if it was a local development environment. Any dependencies or tools that are necessary for the project will be installed in the container, and your code will be saved to the local repository on your machine.

## Conclusion

Using a devcontainer can make it easier for developers to get started with a project, as it provides a consistent and predictable development environment. By following the steps above, you can easily use a devcontainer featured in a Github repo project.
